--== Introduction ==--

This directory contains an implementation of Conway's "Game of Life" which was written for COMP103.  The Game of Life is described in COMP103 Lecture 25, or a general overview can be found here:

--== Contents ==--

The contents of this directory are as follows:

0) This file README.txt

1) A directory "code" containing the Java code for the program (Life.java is the application class).

2) A directory "data" containing data files.  Each data file represents an initial state that can be loaded by the program.  These states were copied from a web site: 

http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex.htm 

New data files can be created for the program by cutting them from the web site and pasting them into a text file in the data directory.  "." represents a cell that is off, and "O" represents a cell that is on.

3) model.pdf - a pdf file which contains an approximate model of the simulation program.

4) A directory "web site".  This contains a zipped version of the web site referred to in 3 above.  Unzip it for a local copy of the web pages listing many interesting start states for Life.
